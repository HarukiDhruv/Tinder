# Tinder
Aiming to master design and front-end development, I decoded how Tinder works, focusing on the sliding photos effect. Using GSAP and Tailwind, I challenged myself after weeks of practice. Despite numerous errors, I cleared my doubts with ChatGPTâ€™s help. The project took time but enhanced my skills. I hope you like the result!
